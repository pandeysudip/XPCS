## Study of the Spin Glass Transition Using Coherent Magnetic X-ray Scattering


##  SCIENTIFIC MOTIVATION
Spin Glass represents a new state of matter which has been intensely studied experimentally and theoretically since the 1970â€™s [1-3]. Spin glass concepts have led to applications in such diverse areas as neural networks, advanced computer algorithms, protein folding, and even economics and theories of social networks science [4-7]. It arises typically in a metallic alloy with randomly distributed magnetic spins, each of which experiences a different exchange field due to the oscillatory nature of the RKKY interactions between the spins with distance. This results in frustration, resulting in the spins freezing into a static disordered configuration. Theory predicted that the transition from the paramagnetic state to the spin glass state would be a continuous second-order phase transition, accompanied by critical fluctuations and the emergence of an order parameter. Edwards and Anderson defined this order parameter (EA order parameter) to be the quantity   summed over all spins in the system [8]. 
There have been several attempts to observe the critical behavior of this phase transition and the appearance of the EA order parameter at spin glass transition temperature (Tg) via neutron scattering experiments over the years [9-15]. However, the existence of a true second-order phase transition from the paramagnetic to the spin glass state accompanied by critical fluctuations has been difficult to establish experimentally with neutron scattering (including NSE) owing to the long-time scales involved and the fact that it is only the non-linear susceptibility which shows critical behavior. In fact, in the theory, the dynamical critical fluctuations would be associated with the correlation function  which is the Fourier Transform of the non-linear dynamical susceptibility. We believed this can conclusively be answered using resonant magnetic X-ray scattering and X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) using coherent photon beams at NSLS-II. Further this quantity can be measured by XPCS in real time for very long-time scales (~ 1000 seconds or more), which is impossible to attain with inelastic scattering, including neutron spin echo.
